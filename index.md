# The favourite actor in my livetime movie 
She's been accompanying me for more than half of my life now.
She helps me managing sad times by letting me forget everything that's around me.
She's got a charming shape and a wonderful sound in her voice.
## This is what makes her special
* her name is "Martin" though she's female
* she's got a wooden flavoured skin
* she's got 6 strings of steel
* she's got a wonderful warm sound
